<div id="top"></div>

This is an academic project developed by <strong>undefined team</strong> @Esprit University Tunisia.
In this repository using laravel 9 to create an application intended to facilitate adopting animals . 
We used blade template engine to create the front-end and bootstrap 5 to style the pages.
We used MySQL as a database and phpMyAdmin to manage it.

## Getting Started

1. wipe your current database if it exists
```sh
  php artisan db:wipe
  ```
2. create a new database
```sh
  php artisan migrate
  ```
3. seed the database
```sh
  php artisan db:seed
  ```
4. install mix depedencies
```sh
  npm install && npm run dev
```
5. run the server
```sh
  php artisan serve
```
6. open the browser and go to 
http://localhost:8000/


## DOCUMENTATION

We implemented both the frontoffice and backoffice of the application.
The frontoffice is the part of the application that is accessible to the public, in which we display some listings of animals and their details, rewards etc ..
The backoffice is the part of the application that is accessible to the admin, in which he is allowed to manage the application, such as adding, deleting, updating animals, rewards, users, etc ..
